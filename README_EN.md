# tvmcr
On October 1, 2025, except for real-name systems and cross-border lines, China Railway Group will completely abolish paper reimbursement vouchers and switch to electronic invoices. In order to enable all car enthusiasts to still see the reimbursement vouchers, this simulated TVM has been specially established. There are multiple styles to choose from (I guess), and the generated reimbursement vouchers are only for commemoration and collection.
